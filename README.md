# Diabetes-Diagnosis-Using-machine-learning
Conducted an end to end data analysis project aimed at predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques. I cleaned and preprocessed medical data, handling incorrect and missing entries effectively. I performed exploratory data analysis, creating visualizations to uncover insights and trends in the dataset. I trained multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Naive Bayes, evaluating each model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. Random Forest and Support Vector Machines provided the most accurate predictions, demonstrating the value of careful data preparation and appropriate model selection in healthcare analytics.
